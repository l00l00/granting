### Overview

This grants program domain is dedicated to funding ongoing operational expenses for the Compound DAO, including maintenance and support for projects completed in other grant domains. It aims to ensure that contributors addressing DAO operational needs with their own resources can receive streamlined funding or reimbursement. 

### Is My Proposal In-Scope?

Eligible proposals must demonstrate a long-established, critical need for the Compound protocol, or receive approval from a prior grant in another domain. Upfront services or support alone do not qualify for funding unless they serve a verified need or have been pre-approved.

### Requests for Proposals (RFPs)

This domain focuses on proposals in three key areas of DAO expenses:

1. **RFP1: On-chain Gas Reimbursements & Funding**  
   Open to contributors who have incurred substantial gas fees for DAO operational transactions. Examples include:
   - Submitting DAO proposals and governance actions
   - Executing multisig transactions related to DAO funding and approvals
   - Relaying transactions for governance or market operations on behalf of users

2. **RFP2: Off-chain Infrastructure Funding**  
   Funding is available to cover costs for essential infrastructure supporting the Compound protocol. Examples include:
   - Web hosting for critical websites like the Compound Forum
   - SaaS subscription costs for essential tools (e.g., GitHub repository subscriptions)

3. **RFP3: Support & Maintenance for Grant Projects**  
   Grants from other domains that have completed their milestones may apply for additional funding for ongoing maintenance. Prior notice of potential recurring funding needs in the original grant proposal can increase funding likelihood. Examples include:
   - Website hosting costs for completed projects
   - Maintenance updates or third-party SaaS subscriptions for tools developed under prior grants

### Grant Criteria

Grants are issued in COMP tokens, with competitive proposals aligning well with community priorities and demonstrating measurable outcomes. The program focuses on two types of expenses:

1. **Past Expenses**:  
   Reimbursements for expenses already incurred out-of-pocket.
2. **Future Expenses**:  
   Anticipated expenses within the next grant year will be considered for funding closer to the program’s end date.

### Proposal Evaluation

The following evaluation criteria are used to assess the proposals, with each criterion scored from 0-5 points:

- **Relevance to Ecosystem**:  
  How directly the proposal addresses one of the RFPs and aligns with Compound’s ecosystem interests.
  
- **Completeness of the Plan**:  
  Proposals should detail the feasibility, cover any potential gaps, and outline a mechanism for community feedback. Clear technical details are important, but proposals should also be accessible to the broader Compound community.

- **Feasibility of Goals and Timeline**:  
  Proposals with quantitative outcomes should include realistic timelines and deliverables. Ideally, the work can be completed within six months of the start date.

High scores improve funding likelihood, but there is no minimum threshold for guaranteed funding. Grant decisions consider both the rubric and a balanced distribution of funds across diverse project types and team sizes.

### Additional Considerations

Proposals showing a strong understanding of Compound’s community will have an advantage, as this aligns project outcomes with community values. The Compound Forum and Discord are valuable resources to explore stakeholder perspectives.
