## In-Scope Proposal Areas

This domain supports creative, actionable developer tools, dapps, and integrations that drive measurable value to the Compound ecosystem. We prioritize new dapps integrating securely and creatively with Compound III (Comet) contracts, particularly in composability. For more details, refer to the [Compound III Developer Resources](https://compound.finance).

### Key Requests for Proposals (RFPs)

#### **Category A**: General Ecosystem Improvements
Encourages new ideas to enhance Compound’s protocol operations, accessibility, reach, or impact.  
*__Note:__ Proposals are encouraged to be bold and experimental.*

#### **Category B**: Developer Tools
- **RFP B1**: New developer tools facilitating the integration of Compound smart contracts with other dapps and protocols.
    - *Reference tools:* Compound JS and Compound Kit.
- **RFP B2**: Improvements to existing developer tools, focusing on security, UI, and UX.
    - *Tip:* Contact current tool teams to align with ongoing efforts.
- **RFP B3**: Documentation enhancements for governance, UI/UX, and developer tools.
    - *Recommendation:* Review existing [Compound III Documentation](https://compound.finance) and community discussions to identify gaps.

#### **Category C**: Dapp Integrations
Integrations should aim to bring in new users, capital, or insights to Compound V3 markets.
- **RFP C1**: Dapps creating new lending activity on Compound V3.
- **RFP C2**: Dapps creating new borrowing activity on Compound V3.
    - Proposals should outline anticipated market activity and include milestones tied to quantifiable growth.

### Broader Ecosystem Support

Ideas not directly fitting other domains may find a home here, especially if they address needs in:
- **Analytics**: Compound V3 analytics tools are highly valued.
- **Education**: Preference for digital and globally accessible strategies.
- **Governance**: Proposals that bolster DAO operations are encouraged.
- **Risk Frameworks**: Proposals complementing Gauntlet’s risk models for Compound V3 are welcome.

### Milestone Requirements

Grants are disbursed in COMP tokens across proposed milestones. Competitive proposals should:
- **Include 3-5 measurable milestones**, ideally tied to quantifiable outcomes (e.g., user growth, activity metrics).
- **Involve community feedback** mechanisms in final milestones to address community input or concerns.

### Audit Requirement

Smart contract proposals directly interacting with Compound require an audit by Compound’s security partner, Open Zeppelin (OZ). This audit milestone must resolve any critical vulnerabilities before COMP disbursement.

## Characteristics of a Strong Proposal

1. **Clear Aims and Scope**: Well-defined problem, solution, impact, and comparative advantages.
    - Budget: Proposals should require funding between $4K and $20K USD equivalent.
2. **Experienced Team**: Demonstrated relevant achievements and ecosystem familiarity.
3. **Outcome-Driven Milestones**: Milestones should tie to measurable outcomes.
4. **Detailed Plan**: Comprehensive, feasible, and accessible to the broader Compound community.
5. **Feasibility**: Practical milestones and timelines aligned with community interests.

## Proposal Review and Evaluation

Proposals are reviewed by the domain allocator, potentially with insights from other allocators. The evaluation rubric scores proposals (0-5) based on:

- **Team Experience**
- **Novelty and Quality of Idea**
- **Ecosystem Relevance**
- **Plan Completeness**
- **Goal and Timeline Feasibility**

> *High scores indicate stronger funding potential, though rubric scores are balanced with factors like project diversity, domain distribution, and grant size considerations.*
