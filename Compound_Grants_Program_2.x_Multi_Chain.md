## Is my proposal in-scope for this domain?

The **Multi Chain Domain** supports proposals related to features that help Compound on other L2s or L1s. The domain hosts the following Requests for Proposals (RFPs):

### Category A: Features that help Compound via Multichain:

- **RFP A1**: Supporting Compound on already deployed L2s or L1s (like Polygon)  
  Features that will greatly support Compound on already deployed L2s or L1s. For example, a dApp that utilizes Compound on Polygon.

- **RFP A2**: New Markets on Existing Chains  
  For example, supporting Compound WETH or native USDC markets set up on L2s.

- **RFP A3**: Connecting Compound via Multichain  
  Features that help smoothly connect between ETH, Polygon, and Base for usage for Compound.

- **RFP A4**: Supporting tools for Compound via Multichain  
  Supporting tools like data dashboards for Compound on Multichain.

> **Important Note:**  
> The domain does **not** plan to give out grants for deploying Compound on other L2s or L1s as they are the ones that should **give grants** to the Compound community instead.

## Milestone Articulation

Grants in this program are disbursed in **COMP**, the governance token of the Compound protocol, in stages according to milestones proposed by builders, ideally in consultation with the domain allocator. Proposals that score well in review but require milestone modifications will need to be resubmitted with the modified milestones after consultation with the domain allocator. It is recommended to reach out early (well before proposal submission) to the domain allocator to discuss and converge on a suitable set of milestones for the proposal.

Competitive proposals in this domain will articulate a set of milestones (3-5 milestones is typical) that are mostly tied to measurable outcomes, i.e., **quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs)**. The proposal should also have the following:

---

### Proposal Requirements

#### Proposal Title  
- Should include the name of the project/team applying.

#### Proposal Summary  
- Short summary of the proposal in a few sentences.

#### Applicant Introduction  
- Share information about the applicant/the applying team’s background, including completed and ongoing integrations/partnerships.

#### Overview of Proposal  
- Detailed description of the proposal, including timeline, budgets, and milestones.

#### Motivation  
- What issues does this proposal address? How does it benefit the Compound ecosystem?

#### Relevance  
- How does it fall under the Multichain domain? (Please specify which RFP it falls under.)

#### Conflict of Interest (if any)  
- For example, has the applicant also received grants from other DeFi protocols?

## Audit Requirement

Proposals that use smart contracts to interact directly with the Compound protocol will be required to undergo an audit with Compound’s security partner, **Open Zeppelin (OZ)**. Detailed requirements will be determined in consultation with the domain allocator and representatives from OZ. Passing the audit, including resolution of any critical or high-risk vulnerabilities to the domain allocator’s and OZ representative’s satisfaction, must be articulated as a milestone in the proposal. Milestones beyond the audit stage will not be eligible for disbursement of COMP until after the audit milestone is successfully met.

## Proposal Review and Evaluation Rubric

Proposals in this domain are typically reviewed directly by the domain allocator. Depending on the proposal content, the domain allocator may consult with allocators in relevant domains and may invite other allocators to provide additional review.

The evaluation rubric consists of five items that are each scored from 0-5 points:

1. **Team Experience**  
   How thoroughly has the team’s past development experience, training, and/or research prepared them to deliver the proposal outcomes? How well has the team demonstrated their understanding of the challenge(s) to be addressed, existing or in-development alternative approaches, and the proposal’s relevance to Compound?

2. **Novelty and Quality of the Idea**  
   To what extent does the proposal represent a new use case or a new approach to the challenge it addresses? How well does the proposal incorporate principles of sustainability (for example, if additional infrastructure is required to support the project beyond the grant timeline, how thorough is the plan to support these costs?) and composability (for example, is the design sufficiently general to allow the community to build on the outcomes of the proposal)?

3. **Relevance to Our Ecosystem**  
   If the proposal directly addresses one of the domain RFPs, how well are the milestones aligned with ecosystem interests?

4. **Completeness of the Plan**  
   Is the level of detail sufficient to assess the feasibility of the proposal? Are there any gaps in the plan that could slow or prevent timely completion of the work? Has the team included a mechanism for soliciting community feedback during project development? How will the results of the proposal be disseminated to the community? Is the proposal written in a manner that provides sufficient technical detail while remaining mostly accessible to the broader Compound community?

5. **Feasibility of Goals and Timeline**  
   For proposals that include quantitative value creation-based milestones, how plausible are the target milestones? How likely is the proposal to be completed within the specified time frame (or within six months of the start date, whichever is earlier)?
